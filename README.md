## <ins>Sprint Challenge 3</ins>
This in-class assignment required students to summarize a predictive analytics project from a peer-reviewed article and assess its adherence to the CRISP-DM guidelines. Additionally, we were asked to upgrade the logistic regression win probability model we produced in class and apply it to an NFL game. Finally, we were required to modify a customer retention model we developed in class.
